pom.xml file should be in the project root directory.
src is the standard directory for your source files.
Within src, main is the standard directory for your application's main source files
java is the directory for your Java source files, within that controller package contains the CalculatorController java class
webapp is the standard directory for your web application files like JSP, CSS and JS files.
WEB-INF is a special directory that contains configuration files and other resources that should not be directly served to clients.
views contains the calculator.jsp file
web.xml and dispatcher-servlet.xml also should be in the WEB-INF directory
